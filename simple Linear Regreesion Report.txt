Predicitng the Delivery time Using Sorting Time
Simple Linear Regression
y= b0 + b1 X
b0,b1 are ==> Features or Parameters
X==> Dependent Variable
Y==> Independent Variable
Loss Function  Or Optimisation Function==> Ordinary Least  Squares

Report for problem 1
* There are very low number of records in data set  so there are  NO MISSING VALUES,NO NAN VALUES ,NO OUTLIERS 
*Since the data set feature Names is in not perfect format ,I  decided to chagnge the name format 
*The Correlation between the dependent and independent variables are(r= 0.82) which means moderatly Correlated.
* calculated  the Predicted values and Errors
* Mean Squared Error and R^2  values are: [r^2 = 0.68] [mse =7.79 ]
 here we are going to use OLS method

Report for problem 2

* There are very low number of records in data set  so there are  NO MISSING VALUES,NO NAN VALUES ,NO OUTLIERS   are present 
* The Data set has dimensions of (21,2)
*Skewness is Slightly Postive Skewness
*Kurtosis is Slightly Negitive Kurtosis
*The Correlation between the dependent and independent variables are(r= 0.92) which means Perfectly  Correlated.
* calculated  the Predicted values and Errors
* Mean Squared Error and R^2  values are:[r^2 = 0.95] [mse =6502000509.014902 ]
